ReadMe PingWiz

- Install all packages in requirements
- You will need a webcam and a phone which is connected to the same hotspot as the computer the game is launched on 
- Run main.py and webserver.py
- Enter the IP address that appears on the console with one player adding a '/player1' and the other '/player2'
- The two players stand in front of the webcam
- To choose your player, you have to point your right arm to the left, straight upwards or right which will choose either the first,second or third penguin. Both players can choose at the same time
- Once your player is chosen, the game will start
- The first player will be the first to attack, you can see if it's your turn by the wand near the life bar. If magic is coming out of it, it's your turn. you will have between 2-5 seconds to choose which spell to cast. To cast a spell, you will press the button corresponding to the spell you want to cast. You have the choice between: fire, water, wind, energy or ultimate
- Every attack deals the same damage points
- In the meantime, the other player has to defend themselves. To do this, they have to move in a defense position fast enough, 
If the spell is blue (which indicates a water/wind spell) they must sweep their right arm in front of their chest in a v shape (with elbow lower than both shoulder and hand)
If the spell is red (which indicates a fire/energy spell) they must put both their hands in the air
If the spell is an oyster (which indicates the ultimate spell) they put their hands in the air and spreed their legs(think jumping jack)
- Once player 2 has protected themselves,  it will be their turn to attack and player 1 will have to defend themselves
- Once you've been hit too many times (your life bar hits 0), you die and the game ends and the player with the penguin still alive wins!
